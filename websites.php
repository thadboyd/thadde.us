<p>I built my first website in 1994, and I haven't stopped.</p>
    
<p>Sometimes I build sites for fun.  Sometimes I build them as a freelancer.  Sometimes I build them for companies like GoDaddy or Titan Media Group.</p>

<p>I built the site you're looking at right now, in PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with the jQuery and jQueryUI libraries.</p>

<p>Below you'll a few more of the sites I've built over the years.  Like what you see?  <a href="contact.php">Contact me</a> for a quote.</p>
